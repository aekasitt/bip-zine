    This is up to the community to decide. It's on the BIP
    author + its supporters to champion the idea. They need
    to spark interest and rally support.

    The beautiful thing about <bitcoin></bitcoin> is it's
    decentralized. Anyone can make a BIP! But that also means
    no one has the authority to tell others how to allocate
    their time + resources. Nobody has to review your BIP,
    or even engage with it.

    It's important that everyone who works
    with a BIP agrees on how to to communicate
    about it. What kinds of terms will be used?
    How will the data be structured? These rules
    of communication are called the protocol.
    It's the one thing that's the same across all
    implementations of a BIP.

    Step 1: Share your idea with the <bitcoin></bitcoin>-dev mailing list.
    This gives the community a chance that the idea hasn't been
    discussed. It also allows people to express concerns early
    in the process and confirm the idea is a net improvement.

    Each BIP has a number (e.g. BIP-324), which makes it easy
    for people to find and reference ideas. It can be hard to
    look for documentation on something that was never filed
    as a BIP!
  </p>
  <p class="text-center">
    Can anything become a BIP?
  </p>
  <p>
    No. BIPs are usually best suited for the kinds of ideas
    that many different software projects will want to use.
    If the idea only pertains to one code base or project,
    it probably should not be a BIP.

    Sometimes you have to be patient. Some new
    popular BIPs sat around for months before
    anyone noticed them.

  <h3>
    Why don't some BIPs move forward? Why don't
    they make it into <bitcoin></bitcoin>?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Oftentimes, while the community may not 
    necessarily oppose a BIP, it doesn't progress
    because not enough people are excited enough
    to put their own energy towards it.
  </p>
  <p class="text-center">
    Other factors include competing proposals, or
    general fatigue around certain topics.
  </p>
  <p class="text-center">
    Some BIPs end up getting withdrawn or rejected.
  </p>
  <p class="text-center">
    Always remember, just because something is a BIP,
    it doesn't mean it's been, or will be adopted :)

    Step 2: Does it sound like your idea has a shot
    at being accepted? Great! Now you can make a draft
    BIP and share it with the mailing list. Make sure
    your work is clear and complete. Use the formatting
    guide from BIP-2, and do *not* assign a number to
    your BIP!

    Tip: It's important your BIP is possible to implement.
    Some authors like to write the code first, before
    introducing the draft BIP to the mailing list.
    This has a few benefits, it
  </p>
  <p class="text-left">
    1. Proves the idea can be implemented
  </p>
  <p class="text-left">
    2. Results in a, "reference implementation," an example
    of how the BIP could be executed
  </p>
  <p class="text-left">
    3. Provides a nice set of developer notes that can be
    used to write the BIP

  <p>
    Step 3: After the community has reviewed your
    draft, and you've made updates you feel are
    appropriate, request to add it to the BIPs
    repository on GitHub by opening something
    called a pull request (PR).
  </p>
  <p>
    Step 4: the BIP editor (person in charge of the
    BIPs repo) reviews + assigns a number to the 
    BIP, as well as a label: Standards Track,
    Informational or Process. Then they accept the
    BIP by merging PR into the repo.
